# Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset

## Objective
The objective of this task is to learn how to load, inspect, and visualize a dataset to understand its trends, distributions, and relationships between variables. This helps build foundational skills in data exploration and descriptive statistics.

## Dataset Used
- **Name:** Iris Dataset
- **Source:** Built-in seaborn dataset
- **Description:** The dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris flowers: *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica*.

## Models Applied
No predictive models were applied in this task.  
Only **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** techniques were used, including:
- Descriptive statistics
- Scatter plots
- Histograms
- Box plots

## Key Results and Findings
- **Sepal length** and **petal length** show clear separation between species, especially for *Setosa* compared to others.
- Histograms revealed a normal-like distribution for sepal length with slight variation between species.
- Box plots identified that *Setosa* has significantly smaller petal widths, with minimal outliers, while *Virginica* has the largest.
- Scatter plots show distinct clustering patterns for the three species.

## Skills Practiced
- Data loading and inspection using **pandas**
- Statistical summaries and dataset overview
- Visualizations with **seaborn** and **matplotlib**
